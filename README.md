# ES-116-Project

This project aimed to design and develop a prototype of a water level monitoring and control system for large water tanks using an ultrasonic sensor. The system detects and displays the water level in the tank and automatically controls the motor based on the water level.

The project was implemented using an Arduino microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor, a relay module, and a DC motor. The ultrasonic sensor was used to measure the water level in the tank, and the microcontroller was programmed to control the motor based on the water level. The relay module was used to switch the motor on and off.

The results showed that the system was able to accurately measure the water level and control the motor accordingly. The system provided highly accurate readings, was non-invasive, and worked in a variety of tank shapes and sizes.

The successful implementation of this prototype has the potential to greatly benefit industries that rely on accurate water level measurements, such as agriculture and manufacturing.

Overall, the system provides an efficient and cost-effective solution for monitoring and controlling water levels in large tanks.
